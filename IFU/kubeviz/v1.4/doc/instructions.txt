** Quick start (for the GUI): **

Click left mouse button to move crosshair (or to select spaxels in Mask mode).
Select image plane with slidebar or using left mouse button in the 
spectrum window. Fine tune image plane selection with "<" and ">" keys.
Fine tune spatial location with cursor keys in spaxel window.
Set wavelength range selection using the "s" key (in spectrum window)
Select Mode -> Sum1 to see the spaxel map over the selected wavelength range 
Drag with right mouse button to change brightness/contrast.
(Click left mouse button to get keyboard focus.)
Toggle zoom to see the zoomed spectrum around the selected wavelength 
Select the lines to fit (and the continuum if required) and those to
be shown in the spec zoom window. Make sure the spectral resolution R
value makes sense.
Click FIT for a single spaxel fit or FIT ALL to fit all spaxels.


** Kubeviz modes: ** 

Kubeviz can be run in three different and complementary ways:
1. Interactive mode. This is the main mode that allows the user to take 
   advantage of all the program functions. This is the default mode. 
2. Batch mode. This mode is called by setting the /batch keyword. The	 
   program automatically performs a fit of all spaxels and saves both	
   the results in a .fits file named [inputfile]_res.fits and the session
   in a file named [inputfile].sav. If /fit_all_lines is set then all the
   lines in the selected lineset are fit (narrow components). Otherwise 
   only the mainline is fit. Needs the redshift keyword to be set.
3. Load session. This mode loads a kubeviz saved session. It is called by
   providing a .sav file instead of a fits input datacube. All other	
   keywords are disregarded. This allows to load a session made in  
   batch mode for quality assessment and further interactive processing. 
In addition an hybrid mode exists. If the keyword resfile is specified a
new session is created but the results saved in the resfile are loaded.  
This allows fit results produced with other codes to be inspected.	

** Description of buttons: **

  **Spaxel Viewer**

The Menu Bar in the spaxel viewer controls the main functions of the	
program. Commands are grouped according to function.			

In the File menu:
  Open: 	      open a new input datacube. The keywords set during the first call
		      are used. The current session is saved before being destroyed.  
  Save image as EPS:  print the current spaxel view into a .eps file.
  Save image as FITS: save the current image and associated noise into a 
             	      fits file. If a linefit image plane is selected it is written
	     	      to the file with the associated 1-sigma uncertainty plane.
  Save cube as FITS:  save the current cube data and noise extension into a
                      fits file.
  Display header:     display the fits header. A dialog box will ask which 
                      header to display (primary, data or noise).
  Save session:       save the current session (snapshot of the allocated memory)
		      into a file. 
  Load session:       load a saved session. 
  Quit:               close kubeviz and free the memory. The session is saved into 
                      "lastsession.sav"

In the Cube menu:
  Data:       	  show the datacube
  Noise:      	  show the noisecube
  BadPixels:  	  show the badpixelmask
  S/N:            show the signal to noise cube. Both data and noise spectra are
              	  shown in the spectrum viewer.
  Linefit:    	  show spaxel fit map. Does not work with masks. If no result
	      	  plane is set in the linefit window the flag map is shown
  Linefit errors: show the average +/- 1 sigma error map
  Linefit S/N:    show the linefit significance (value/avg. err) map. 

In the Zcut menu:
  Select the color scale for the spaxel viewer. The default is HistEq.
  The User defined cuts can be changed interactively in User parameters. 
  After the limits have been chosen,clicking on APPLY makes the User 
  linear cut active by default.

In the Colour menu:
  Select one of the color schemes. Default is Grey.  
  Invert: invert the current color scheme.

In the Cursor menu:
  Crosshair: activate the crosshair. If mask mode is active this reverts to 
	     spaxel mode.
  None:      removes any active cursor (mask or spaxel). The last fit mode 
	     remains active.

In the Spax.Masks menu:
  Select:        switches to mask mode. Click left mouse button to select spaxels.
  Deselect:      click left mouse button to deselect spaxels.
  Clear:         deselects all mask spaxels. The mask is not deleted.
  Optimal Mask:  automatically define a mask based on spaxels with S/N > 5 in 
                 the currently displayed image.
  New Mask:      define a new empty mask. Step through masks with keys "k" and "l" 
  Save:          save the current mask. 
  Load:          load a saved mask. 
  Delete Mask:   delete the current mask. The last mask cannot be deleted.
  Go to Mask:    a dialog appears and the user can set to which mask to move. 
                 Useful in case many masks are defined.
  Previous Mask: Go to the previous mask
  Next Mask:     Go to the following mask		
  
In the Mode menu:
   Slice:         show a single wavelenght slice. 
   Sum1:          compute the summed image over selected wavelength range. The range 
                  can be selected by pressing the "s" key in the spectrum viewer.
   Median1:       as Sum1 but compute the median image. 
   Weighted Avg1: compute the inverse variance weighted average of the flux
                  values over selected wavelength range.
   Weighted Med1: as above but compute the inverse variance weighted median.		  
   MedSub1:       show a single slice minus the median image over selected range.
   
   Options with 2 refer to the second wavelength range. It can be defined using
   the Sel Range button in the spectrum viewer. A second range can be selected by
   pressing Sel Range --> Range2 in the spectrum viewer and then defined with the
   "s" key.
   
   Med2 - Med1:  show the difference of the median images over the two selected
	         ranges. 
   Med1 - Med2:  same as above but reversed.
	      
In the Errors menu:
  Use the five options to switch between different error methods. If  
  a method is called for the first time the corresponding cubes are created.
  Montecarlo methods can use a lot of RAM memory. Make sure you have enough free
  memory before calling one of those methods. A back of the envelope math to assess
  how much memory you need is to assume N [100] times the size of the input datacube
  (only the data extension). 
  0) Noise cube: use the fit uncertainties from the inverse variance weighted fit.  
  1) Bootstrap cubes (requires multi-extension bootstrap cubes-frame as input)
  2) Monte Carlo 1 : generates monte-carlo cubes by adding random gaussian 
     distributed errors with the noise cube as amplitude and THEN smoothing. 
  3) Monte Carlo 2 : as Monte Carlo 1 but smooths before generating the cubes.
  4) Monte Carlo 3 : as Monte Carlo 2 but with residuals from a first fit   
     instead of the noise cube. The residuals are also randomly shifted along 
     the wavelength axis.
     
In the Options menu:
  Smooth parameters: pops-up a window where the smooth parameters can be changed.
    This has effect only after a click on the Apply button. The current linefit
    results are reset. Consider saving them first!
  Use Montecarlo Noise: switch on/off the option to use the noise computed from
     the montecarlo realisations. The default is off.
  Save Montecarlo Plots: switch on/off the option to save diagnostic plots 
     of distribution of results with multiple realisations.
  Save Montecarlo PDFs: switch on/off the option to save all the results from the
     fit of montecarlo cubes in a FITS table.
  Scale Noisecube Error: switch on/off the option to rescale the formal fit errors
     assuming a chisq per degree of freedom equal to 1.      
  Load Results File: load an external file where Kubeviz fit results are stored.
  
In the Help menu:
  What's new:         display a detailed change-log. 
  Instructions:       display this document. 
  Keyboard shortcuts: display a list of keyboard shortcuts. 		   

The bottom part of the spaxel viewer lists some useful info about the currently
active visualization mode. The coordinates of the selected spaxel are given in 
the Image frame which corresponds to the shown image and in Physical coordinates
which are the coordinates in the original cube. Those values are different only
if a portion of the cube has been loaded using the trim keyword. The third value
is the spaxel value in the current view. The WCS coordinates are RA, DEC and 
Lambda (in Angstrom). The current values of the smooth parameters, of the number
of defined masks as well as the selected cube and wavelength mode are also shown.

  **Spectrum Viewer**

The buttons in the spectrum viewer allow you to change the parameters to inspect 
the spectra.
  zmin and zmax: set the spectrum flux scale (and the spaxel color scale for 
		 User and Sqrt zcuts) 
  Fix Scale: toggle the fixed vs auto flux scale. 
  Toggle Zoom: show/hide the spectral zoom window. Change the zoom using + or -.
  Save: save the current spectrum + noise spectrum in fits format. 
  Sel Range: select the container (1 or 2) to store user defined spectral
	     region. A Reset button is also available. 
  Mode: select the spectrum view mode. Slice: show a single spaxel spectrum.   
	Sum, Median, Weighted average (in combination with a mask) 
	show the summed/median/average spectrum of the selected spaxels. 
	Optimal: use the Robertson (1986) method to obtain an optimal extraction 
	over the selected spaxels. The method is designed for point-like sources 
	and is sensitive to the background subtraction quality. Use with caution!

  **Linefit Window**

The linefit window allows the user to set the parameters for the fit, perform the 
fit and see the results in real-time. 
Several options and parameters can be specified.

The fit is performed in linesets (set of lines to be fitted simultaneously). Several
linsets are defined in kubeviz, each having a mainline. The linesets are: 

  1: Ha (6562A) + [NII] (6548,6584A)   Mainline: Ha 
  2: Hb (4851A) 		       Mainline: Hb 
  3: [OIII] (4959,5007A)	       Mainline: [OIII] (5007A) 
  4: [SII]  (6716,6731A)	       Mainline: [SII]  (6731A) 
  5: [OI]   (6300,6364A)	       Mainline: [OI]	(6364A) 
  6: [SIII]
  7: [HeI]
  8: Lya (1215A)                       Mainline: Lya
  
If the lineset keyword is not set all the lines are searched into the spectrum   
using the provided redshift. Those falling into the valid wavelength
range can be fit. In future it will be possible to read a list of lines and the 
associated linesets from a user defined file.
The redshift keyword is mandatory for the fit. If it has not been set during the 
kubeviz call it should be manually edited. Alternatively it can be interactively 
defined by selecting a wavelenght slice and pressing "z" in the spectrum viewer. 
In this case the idenfitied line is assumed to be the mainline of the active lineset.

For each line a narrow and broad component can be fit togheter with the continuum.
The show buttons make the fit to the selected component appear
overplotted in the spectral zoom window. 
The region of the spectrum to be included in the fit can be modified by changing
the values of the Fitting Range. (blue- and red-wards w.r.t. the mainline)
The continuum is fit by defining two "continuum regions" offset by +/- [min,max]
from the mainline, then taking the values within two percentiles and fitting a  
polinomium. All these parameters and the order of polinomium can be changed.	
The continuum regions where another line is expected are rejected.
The fit can be constrained by specifying start values (if they are not set they 
are guessed automatically) and boundaries for each parameter. The user limits are 
used only if the button "Fit with constraints?" is set.
The fix buttons can be used to fix a parameter to the start value. The line ratios
of OI, OIII and NII lines can be fixed during the fit and the values of the ratios
are from Storey & Zeippen 2000. In this case no errors are output for the flux of 
the fainter line.

The instrumental resolution at the wavelength of the mainline needs to be computed 
in order to obtain the intrinsic line width. For all the instruments it can be 
estimated by fitting the peaks in the variance spectrum, assumed to be skylines. The 
accuracy of this method depends on the presence of strong skylines in the wavelength 
region of interest and typically works well in the NIR (Y,J,H, partially in K). 
For KMOS, the resolution can be described by a polynomial as a function of wavelength. 
If the polynomial coefficients are written in the datafile header they are uploaded. 
Otherwise they are sourced from the kubeviz templates directory which hosts general 
curves for each IFU at different observing epochs. The closest in time to the 
current data is used.

The buttons in the bottom part of the window allow you to perform the fit and inspect 
the results. The active error method and the status of the "Montecarlo plots"	   
option are also shown. Description of the available buttons:
  FIT:      fit the current spaxel/mask.
  FIT ALL!: fit all spaxels/masks. After the fit each result is flagged as OK or  
	    BAD according to the following criteria: 
	    - S/N of at least one line > mask_sn_thresh and 
	    - velocity (and dispersion) error < mask_maxvelerr. 
  AUTO FLAG ALL!: Flag the results of the fit spaxels/masks. The flag
                  for a current spaxel can be altered by left clicking
		  on the flag value OK/BAD. The autoflag thresholds can be
		  changed interactively. 
  FIT ADJ: fit spaxels with BAD flag where they are adjacent to other spaxels with  
	   flag OK, using the solution from the adjacent spaxels for an initial     
	   guess. The procedure iterates until no more successes. 
  FLAG ON/OFF: When one of the linefit maps is displayed this button shows/hides   
	       the spaxels with BAD flag.
  SAVE:    save the current error method results into a fits file. Details on how the 
	   result planes are packed into a single result cube are given in the header. 
  RESET ALL PARS: reset the currently displayed results and the editable options to 
		  defaults. Has the same effect as clicking each reset button.     
		  User defined limits and button selections are not reset. 
  RESET USER PARS: reset the user supplied start, min and max values for the fit   
		   with constraints.
  MASK/SPAXEL: switch between mask and spaxel fitting mode. Cursor mode is changed
	       accordingly. The "-" and "+" buttons on the top of the window allow 
	       to step through masks (only if mask mode is selected).
  GAUSS/MOMENTS: switch between fitting a gaussian profile or computing the moments
                 of a given line. Some options are available only in one of the two 
		 modes. If the moments method is selected, a threshold (th) can be 
		 applied to select only flux values th times above the continuum noise.
		 The threshold is not applied for the 0th order moments (integrated 
		 fluxes).
