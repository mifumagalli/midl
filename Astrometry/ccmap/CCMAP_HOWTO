This is a compilation of code to make wcs with iraf task ccmap in a
easier way

1) Prepare multiextension file with ccmap_multiext.pro
   It is better to create a new folder and run the code form there
   since it makes a lot of files 

2) Run on a group of similar files (that share the same reference frame)
   ccmap_xyradec (run on each chip separately). [iraf in xgterm]
   Save regions as xy image.

3) Run the scrip in iraf-ccmap to make the wcs fit	
   Check epar units in degree!!!
   Set update image yes.

4) Reconstruct the multiextension files with ccmap_remulti
	
For the reference image,  get SDSS image via montage 
http://hachi.ipac.caltech.edu:8080/montage/ or use dss

To run the script in iraf
task $submean=home$submean.cl
submean

In IRAF/ccdmap, the fit is interactive:
d: delete une point
f: fit
q: accept the solution
r: work on residual plane
