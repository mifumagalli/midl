3D version of van Dokkum's LA Cosmic bad pixel correction.

This code uses Laplacian edge detection in exactly the same way as
LACosmic. However, because it is designed to run of data cubes rather
than images, there are a number of important differences in the
overall procedure. An outline is given below.

NOTES:

It is best to use the internally generated noise cube (although this
takes a long time to estimate). 

The default values of s_lim=5 and f_lim=2 seem to work fine for the
SINFONI cubes I have tested the routine on.

It is best to remove any planes in the cube which have only NaN. This
is quicker, and also allows for better correction at the edges of the
cube (since they are wrapped round).

PROCEDURE OUTLINE:

Continuum sources (i.e. spectrally but not spatially extended) are
traced and removed, using a 49 pixel median filter in the wavelength domain.

The same is done for spatially but not spectrally extended sources
(with a 7x7 median in the spatial plane).

What's left is effectively the 'source cube' in which bad pixels will
be identified and removed.

The fine structure in this source cube is then mapped using a 3x3x3
median. 

The noise map is generated from the residual (after subtracting the
fine structure) as the stddev of a pixels in a 5x5x5 box (after
removing the highest 25 and lowest 25).

Then the iterations for bad pixels start. At each iteration, bad
pixels are identified in the source cube using the 3D Laplacian. They
are replaced with those from the fine structure cube. 
The fine structure and noise cubes are then updated. 
The routine performs up to 5 iterations by default.

At the end, the corrected source cube has the continuum & spatial
structure added back in.
