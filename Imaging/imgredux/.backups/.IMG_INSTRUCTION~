This is a pipeline that reduces imaging from different telescopes.
It is semiautomatic and it works in steps.

Work on images that are NOT gzipped!!


Requires: 
IDL,Swarp,Scamp,WCSTools,SExtractor 


1) Get all the images together: bias (not required), flats and images.
   in a Raw folder. gzip as you wish. Then create a imgredux folder 
   which is where everyting will happen. Enter this folder and 
   start the pipeline. 


2) Run img_makeplan.pro that reads the header and try to figure out  
   what files do you have. This is not perfect (e.g. std will be flagged as 
   flats etc..). So you will nedd to edit the output before moving to point 3.
   By entering an appropriate group name, you'll be able to to move quickly 
   through the second step of the reduction, when objects are combined 
   together. A single combination of object should be chosen as a group. 
   Subgroups will be handled automatically looking at the filter field. 
   A 0 means skip that object.    


3) Make the reduction of individual frames with img_ccdproc.
   This procedure does the following:

	- creates median bias
        - creates flats
        - process science frame by 
                  .subtracting bias with oscan 
                  .apply flat field
		  .apply gain and rescale mosaic to common level
		  .divide by exposure time
		  .compute a weight image with flats
		  .run la_cosmic to find CR and updates weight
		  .update the header

   At this point, every image is reduced, in units of e/s
   If there are nasty pathological cases that need masking by hand, just 
   add a file namefile.mask to a mask subfolder. This has to be a ds9 
   region file in IRAF format (image corrdinates) with boxes
   



4) At this point call img_processall which does some preparation for 
   img_wcsstack, such as preparation of the images assigning a first coarse 
   wcs solution and fixing the problem of multiextension if needed
   	- prepare the header with keyword used by scamp/swarp
	- run sextractor to make a source catalogue

   To fit wcs and combine the final image, use img_wcsstack.pro 
   This procedure reads a list of reduced frame you want to combine and
	- run scamp to fit astrometry. The default mode is for
	  telescope with multiple ccd and the code solves iteratively
 	  for a mosaic. 
	- prepare the images for stacking and runs swarp.
 	  Images are mean weighted combined. Scales are based on 
	  first photometric attempt by scamp. Images are reprojected with 
	  interpolation. Fluxes are also scaled for a constant values
	  that compansate for repixeling (works ok if distorsions are not big)
	- A final combined, wcs image is written. Weight is appended in 
	  last extension. Sky sub happens here too
	
   If the stacked image has defects you can run img_deepclean within the   
   swarp folder to flag more aggressively cosmic rays or mask by 
   hands defects.  
	
   @ If WCS fails, can mock with deltawcs to improve first aligment. 
   If does not qork, refine the fit on offending image by hand with 
   midl/Astrometry/ccmap

   To deal with the aggressive LRIS red cosmic rays, first run scamp 
   in resemple mode, then run the img_sigmaclip procedure and 
   finally run scamp in combine mode using img_mancomb.pro


5) Finally, img_register.pro  perform the last operation for fields images 
   with multiple filters.
   
   The code takes the first image as reference and register all the other 
   images to that one, using the wcs information.
   It also generates a mean combined white image that can be used to 
   identify sources. Finally, the code makes a series of diagnostic plot 
   for relative and absolute astrometry.

   This does not correct for distorsions, so it's not really recommended.
