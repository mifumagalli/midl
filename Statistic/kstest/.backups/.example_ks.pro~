y2=randomn(seed,2000)

print, 'probability drawn from same parent distribution=',$
     ks2d(x1,y1,x2,y2)
print, '(should be close to 1, or at least not near zero)'

print,''


;make a subtle shift in one of the distributions

print, 'probability drawn from same parent distribution=',$
     ks2d(x1+.1,y1,x2,y2)
print, '(should be a little less than last value)'

print,''


;now see how they compare when distributions have different spreads
x2=randomn(seed,2000)*5.

print, 'probability drawn from same parent distribution=',$
