Oct. 23 2006  REVISION 1.01: 
CHANGES: replaced previous version of lcdm.pow, with new good version.
            Due to a bug, previous version of lcdm.pow had ns=1.0, 
            when it was meant to have ns=0.951.
            Code itself is unchanged.

Please cite Reed, Bower, Frenk, Jenkins, and Theuns 2007, MNRAS, 374, 2
if you use this code.  
Note: Code refers to this mass function as Reed et al 2006, but final 
publication date is 2007.


to compile: gmake genmf

code expects to find an input power spectrum file called "lcdm.pow"
 which has 2 columns  k  P(k)   in Mpc/h units
 a sample "lcdm.pow" file is included with a 
 WMAP 3year cosmology power spectrum made with CMBFAST
      assuming omega_m = .24, omega_lambda=0.76, sigma_8=0.74, n_s=0.951,
      extrapolated to very small k with slope of k**-1, 
      exptrapolated to and very high k with slope k**-3 

 The transfer function used to make this power psectrum is a density weighted
 linear combination of the dark matter and baryon transfer function at z=0.  
 To avoid a small kink at high k, a z=399 transfer function is spliced
 onto the z=0 transfer function for k > 1 h/Mpc.



example to run: 
./genmf 0.23831863389003569 0.76168136610996429 .74 0. z0.mf 0

 for WMAP 3 year cosmology
(omega_m = .238, omega_lambda=0.752, sigma_8=0.74, n_s=0.951
omega_b=0.0418, h=73km/s/mpc):





 Usage: genfn omega_m om_lam sig_8_z0 z outfile opt
 
 omega_m  =  The value of Omega_m at redshift zero.
 om_lam   =  The value of Omega_lambda at redshift zero.
 sig_8_z0 =  The norm of the power spectrum at z=0
 z        =  The redshift for which the mass function
                                          is required.
 outfile  =  Name of the output file written by code
 opt = Option for mass function 
 opt = 0 -Reed et al 2006, with n_eff dependence
 opt = 1 -Reed et al 2006, without n_eff dependence
 opt = 2 -Sheth-Tormen
 opt = 3 -Jenkins et al 2001
 opt = 4 -Warren et al 2005
 opt = 5 -Reed et al 2003
 opt = 6 -Press-Schechter
   
 default input powspec is file called lcdm.pow
    2 column file, k[h/Mpc]  P(k)[Mpc**3/h**3]
 modify func powspec for other power spectrum choices
   
 All units in (comoving) Mpc/h and Msun/h
   
 Output is 7 columns
 log10m(Msun/h) dn/dlog10m  n(>m)  ln(1/sigma(m,z)) f  sigma(m,z)  n_eff
 where n is the comoving abundance per cubic Mpc/h
 n_eff is the effective power spectrum slope
  n_eff approx.= 6 dln(1/sigma(m))/dlnm -3
